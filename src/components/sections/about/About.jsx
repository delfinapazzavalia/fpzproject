          I am a student at Colegio Pucara, pursuing a Bachelor of Business
          Administration in Econom√≠a financiera y actuarial. I am passionate
          about applying mathematical and statistical methods to analyze and
          solve financial and insurance problems. I have gained practical
          experience in financial modeling, risk management, and data analysis
          through various academic projects and internships. I have also
          developed strong communication, teamwork, and problem-solving skills
          that enable me to contribute to different scenarios and contexts. My
          goal is to become a professional analyst who can provide valuable
          insights and solutions to the financial and actuarial sectors.
